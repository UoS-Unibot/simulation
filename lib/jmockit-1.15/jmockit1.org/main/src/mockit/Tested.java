/**
 * Indicates a class to be tested, with optional automatic instantiation and/or automatic injection of dependencies.
 * This annotation is applicable to instance fields of a test class; alternatively, it can be used as a meta-annotation
 * on a user-defined annotation which, in turn, needs to have runtime retention and be applicable to fields.
 * <p/>
 * If the tested field is not {@code final} and its value remains {@code null} at the time a test method is about to be
 * executed, then a suitable instance of the tested class is created and assigned to the field.
 * At this time, <em>constructor injection</em> will take place, provided all of the constructor parameters (if any) can
 * be satisfied with the values of available {@linkplain Injectable injectable} fields and/or injectable test method
 * parameters.
 * If the tested class has a constructor annotated with the standard CDI annotation "<code>@Inject</code>", then it is
 * the one to be used;
 * otherwise, if there are multiple satisfiable constructors then the one with the most parameters <em>and</em> the
 * widest accessibility (ie, first {@code public}, then {@code protected}, then <em>package-private</em>, and finally
 * {@code private}) is chosen.
 * The matching between <em>injectable</em> fields/parameters and <em>constructor</em> parameters is done by
 * <em>type</em> when there is only one parameter of a given type; otherwise, by type <em>and name</em>.
 * <p/>
 * Whenever the tested object is created automatically, <em>field injection</em> is also performed.
 * Only non-<code>final</code> fields are considered, between those declared in the tested class itself or in one of its
 * super-classes; at this time constructor injection already occurred, so only <em>eligible</em> fields which remain
 * uninitialized are targeted; eligible fields are those annotated with a standard DI annotation (one of
 * {@code @Inject}, {@code @PersistenceContext}, {@code @PersistenceUnit}), or any <em>instance</em> fields when such
 * annotations are not being used.
 * For each such <em>target</em> field, the value of a still unused {@linkplain Injectable injectable} field or test
 * method parameter of the <em>same</em> type is assigned, if any is available.
 * Multiple target fields of the same type can be injected from separate injectables, provided each target field has the
 * same name as an available injectable field/parameter of that type.
 * Finally, if there is no matching and available injectable value for a given target field, it is left unassigned.
 * <p/>
 * Whenever constructor or field injection is used, the value of each injectable mock field/parameter goes into
 * <em>at most one</em> matching constructor parameter or instance field of a tested class.
 * <p/>
 * The tested class can be {@code abstract}.
 * In this case, if the tested field is left null then a subclass implementing all abstract methods is automatically
 * generated and instantiated.
 * The abstract method implementations are automatically <em>mocked</em> so that expectations can be recorded or
 * verified on them.
 * <p/>
 * This annotation is not only intended for <em>unit</em> tests, but also for <em>integration</em> tests.
 * In the second case, the {@link #fullyInitialized} attribute will normally be specified as {@code true}, so that all
 * eligible fields in the tested object get initialized with a suitable instance, which itself is recursively
 * initialized in the same way.
 *
